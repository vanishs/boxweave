# Remediation validation and next-Agent queue

This is an append-only *planned vs executed* ledger. Do not write PASS unless the command actually ran, its exit/status was inspected, and the source/environment are recorded. The repository edit session operates through the GitHub connection **without a runnable trusted checkout**, so it cannot claim routine Linux or browser tests.

| Change | Test to run in authorized environment | Present evidence / acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.10.0 baseline, R-00/R-01 | `python scripts/check_knowledge.py`; link/README/VERSION/lock/scope consistency; `npm --prefix web ci && npm --prefix web run build` | U — not run in this source-only edit. Check especially retained historical links and IDs |
| Bootstrap/installer R-02 | Shell syntax, explicit-help/no-side-effect dry run, malformed inputs, existing Incus/Provider intact, isolated Ubuntu 24.04 fresh-host+reinstall+repair, signed/pinned upstream provenance, no-secret output | U — no host installation authorized |
| Management CLI R-05 | Read-only help, no config, missing service, version mismatch, forbidden target, no secret content, MCP-down; exact exit contracts | U — no host/user manager available |
| App distribution | `.venv/bin/python scripts/validate.py` and `tests/test_distribution.py`; isolated package build/install/upgrade, DB backup/marker, re-run and admin setup | U — old historical evidence does not count for new source |
| Web/clients | `.venv/bin/python scripts/validate.py --browser` seven fixture flows, plus separately approved four-profile Windows live registration/GUI | U — fixture is not real client evidence |
| Provider/Incus/Tenant | Independent MCP initialize/discovery/read; pinned upstream capabilities; authorized policy/packet, boot/confinement, public TLS | U — requires explicit live authorization |

Keep source SHAs, exact commands/exits, stdout/stderr redaction, any retained fixtures, known failures and required permissions in the actual Agent's result. Do not run live test drivers without their original scope and cleanup approval.

## 0.11.0 read-only management CLI — R-05 partial

Changed: `bwmini/manage.py`, `boxweave.sh`, distribution archive member list and five independent unit tests. An analogous standalone source copy was checked with `python -m py_compile` (exit 0), `bash -n boxweave.sh` (exit 0), and `PYTHONPATH=. python -m unittest -v tests/test_manage.py` (five passing tests, exit 0). The submitted shell wrapper differs in its equivalent `$0` location expression and the submitted tests have slightly different formatting; **full submitted-revision testing was not run**. Next Agent: execute project suite, real Incus exact inspect, missing/foreign user-service, real authenticated MCP read, build/reinstall archive containing CLI wrapper, and secret leak review.

## 0.12.0 host entry — R-02 partial

Changed: `install.sh`, safety tests, operator documentation. Analogous isolated copy: `bash -n install.sh` exit 0, `bash install.sh --help` exit 0, `PYTHONPATH=. python -m unittest -v tests/test_host_bootstrap.py` exit 0 (three tests). The submitted source and tests require new checkout validation; this environment is Debian and **no Ubuntu/Provider/app install was attempted**. Next Agent must test a malicious/missing symlinked artifact, user/session bus, deliberate root provisioning, exact package digest, first admin, successful MCP read, service restart, DB backup, interrupted update repair. Full new-host installer still blocked by secure launcher, credentials, account/bus/bootstrap and root installer integration acceptance.

## 0.13.0 CI and traceability

Changed: non-privileged GitHub Actions checks, new version/README metadata validation and unit test, REQ-019/020 and AC-019/020, ADR-007, risks/matrix/source register. The workflow has not been observed running for this new commit; actual runner SHA/status/logs must be retrieved before reporting success. Linux fixture browser and upstream/host tests remain separate.

## 0.13.1 corrective patch

GitHub Actions run 40980715266 for 0.13.0 commit ca3d06d failed `Documentation, release metadata, and traceability` with exit 1 and exact diagnostic `README does not declare the current release version`; subsequent steps were skipped. Cause: README front page still said 0.10.0 after multiple feature-version bumps. Patch updates README and VERSION/Python/Web/lock root to 0.13.1. Re-run CI on this SHA; do not infer build/test results from the earlier interrupted run.

## 0.13.2 semantic and browser audit

Added [F-001–F-015 parity table](FEATURE_PARITY_ARCHIVE_051.md), [Web source/navigation mapping](WEB_WORKFLOW_PARITY.md), and clarified the selected four Windows-hosted client profiles. All parity verdicts are source/decision judgments; **no new browser or Windows runtime acceptance**. Next Agent: run seven `--browser` fixture scripts individually and four selected Windows client scenarios. Keep fixture/source/historical/real evidence distinct, record actual stdout/exit and console/screenshot artifacts.
